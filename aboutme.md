Hey, how's it going? My name is Jarrett Grande and I am very ecstatic to see that you have came to check out my portfolio.
A little bit of information about myself is that: I am a current student enrolled in the Data Science program at Lambda School, I love having my morning cups of coffee, I used to live in Seattle, Washington, and I am a proud blue nose pit bull owner of a doggo named Midas!
Amongst this anthology, I will be showcasing my latest work as a junior data scientist throughout the duration of my time at Lambda, as well as showing little previews about upcoming projects. The primary focus upon this portfolio is to display the amount of hard work and dedication that I have put into my projects that will be based on solely on coding. Might I add, that I have absolutely zero coding experience prior to this. I am simply just exploring and learning as I develop into a hopeful data scientist.
